# 8BW_TASK_AUTOMATION
This Python script automates file renaming in a specified directory by adding a user-defined prefix. Using the os module, it navigates, lists files, and renames each by appending the chosen prefix. The user customizes the directory path and prefix. With error handling, the script offers a concise solution for efficient batch file renaming.
